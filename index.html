          <p class="pt-3">Welcome! I'm currently a Senior at Clemson University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree 
            in Computer Science, complemented by a minor in Cybersecurity, and set to graduate in May 2025.</p>
          <p class="pb-2">I have a deep interest in software development and the ever-evolving realm of technology. 
            During my time at Clemson, I developed a strong interest in the fields of software development for embedded 
            systems and Cloud Engineering. My academic journey has not only deepened my passion for computer science and 
            Cybersecurity but also expanded my focus to include these exciting areas.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">I look forward to pursuing a professional career in software development for embedded systems 
              and Cloud Engineering, where I can apply my skills and continue exploring these dynamic fields.</p>

          <p>
            As a dedicated Computer Science major, I am currently focused on advancing my expertise through courses like 
            Cloud Computing Architecture and Usable Privacy and Security. These subjects have provided me with invaluable 
            insights into designing scalable systems and understanding critical aspects of data security and user privacy. 
            The hands-on learning in these areas has significantly deepened my technical knowledge and problem-solving capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>I am also excited to announce that after graduating in May 2025, I will begin my journey as a Software Engineering 
            intern at Sentec. In this role, I will work on solving complex challenges in embedded systems, assist in automating 
            software testing processes, create technical documentation, and provide support across various teams. This internship 
            will allow me to refine my technical expertise, gain hands-on experience in a professional environment, and build a solid 
            foundation for a career in software engineering.</p>
            <p>I am genuinely excited and deeply grateful for this opportunity to contribute to Sentecâ€™s innovative projects while 
              furthering my knowledge and skills.</p>

              In the Web Application Development course, I developed full-stack web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
              Within this course, I also built responsive, dynamic web projects with RESTful APIs and AJAX for asynchronous updates. All Projects
              and more can be found on my GitHub.
